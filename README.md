# Avionics Flight Software

This project delivers a high-performance, RTOS-based avionics flight computer for the Arduino Portenta H7, designed for autonomous rocket recovery and telemetry. It integrates multi-sensor fusion—combining GNSS, IMU, and BMP3XX barometric data with an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)—to provide precise real-time state estimation and robust flight stage detection (Calibration, Prelaunch, Launch, Deploy, Landed). Featuring concurrent threads for decision-making and XBee telemetry transmission, the system ensures reliable parachute deployment based on acceleration, velocity, and orientation thresholds, meeting rigorous standards for stability and mission success.
